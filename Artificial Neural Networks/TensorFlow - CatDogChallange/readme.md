# TensorFLow and Convolutional Networks

# The goal
  - the goal of this project is to show how to use Tensorflow to process our own data and train Conv Nets theory with TensorFlow.

  1. read in data
  2. make an input queue
  3. generate batches
  4. train
  5. save model architecture and parameters
  6. restore model architecture and parameters
  7. test new data

# The data
  - Data: The cats vs. dogs [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data) from Kaggle were used
